# Data Analysis for Genomics

## NEWS:

May 7, 2014: in order to clean up and trim down the memory size of
this repo, we've moved out non-code objects
out of this repo. Therefore, before submitting a pull request,
please first clone a clean copy of the repository.
The celfiles and agilent folder of week2 has been
moved to the `rawdata` repo, and the reading microarray lab has
been updated to reflect this.
