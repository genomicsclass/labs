# Introduction

"Correlation is not causation" is one of the most important lessons you should take from this or any other data analysis course. A common example for why this statement is so often true is confounding. Simply stated confounding occurs when we observe a correlation or association between $X$ and $Y$ but  this is strictly the result of both $X$ and $Y$ depending on an extraneous variable $Z$. Here we describe Simpson's paradox, perhaps the most famous case of confounding and then show an example of confounding in high throughput biology.

# Simpson's paradox

Admission data from Berkeley 1973 showed more men were being admitted than women: 44\% men admitted compared to 30\% women. This actually led to a [lawsuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox#Berkeley_gender_bias_case). See: PJ Bickel, EA Hammel, and JW O'Connell. Science (1975)


```{r}
library(dagdata)
data(admissions)
admissions$total=admissions$Percent*admissions$Number/100
##percent men get in
sum(admissions$total[admissions$Gender==1]/sum(admissions$Number[admissions$Gender==1]))
##percent women get in
sum(admissions$total[admissions$Gender==0]/sum(admissions$Number[admissions$Gender==0]))
```

A chi-square test clearly rejects they hypothesis that gender and admission are independent:
```{r}
##let's make a 2 x 2
index = admissions$Gender==1
men = admissions[index,]
women = admissions[!index,]
menYes = sum(men$Number*men$Percent/100)
menNo = sum(men$Number*(1-men$Percent/100))
womenYes = sum(women$Number*women$Percent/100)
womenNo = sum(women$Number*(1-women$Percent/100))
tab = matrix(c(menYes,womenYes,menNo,womenNo),2,2)
print(chisq.test(tab)$p.val)
```

But closer inspection shows a paradoxical results. Here are the percent admissions by Major:
```{r}
y=cbind(admissions[1:6,c(1,3)],admissions[7:12,3])
colnames(y)[2:3]=c("Male","Female")
y
```

**Optional homework**: Run the `chisq.test` in each major.

```{r}
y=cbind(admissions[1:6,c(1,2)],admissions[7:12,2])
colnames(y)[2:3]=c("Male","Female")
y
```

What's going? 

This is called _Simpson's paradox_ 
Note that males were much more likely to apply to "easy" majors. 

Male and easy majors are confounded. 
```{r}
y=cbind(admissions[1:6,5],admissions[7:12,5])
y=sweep(y,2,colSums(y),"/")*100
x=rowMeans(cbind(admissions[1:6,3],admissions[7:12,3]))

library(rafalib)
mypar2(1,1)
matplot(x,y,xlab="percent that gets in the major",ylab="percent that applies to major",col=c("blue","red"),cex=1.5)
legend("topleft",c("Male","Female"),col=c("blue","red"),pch=c("1","2"),box.lty=0)
```


## Confounding explained graphically


In the plots below each letter represents a person. Accepted individuals are denoted with green and not admitted in orange. The letter denotes the major. In this plot we group all the patients together and notice that the proportion of green is larger for men.


```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width=14,fig.height=7}
###make data for plot
library(rafalib)
mypar()
CEX=0.5
NC <- 70
tmp=rowSums(tab)
FNC <- round(NC*tmp[2]/tmp[1])
SCALE <- 1

makematrix<-function(x,n,addx=0,addy=0){
  m<-ceiling(length(x)/n)
  expand.grid(1:n+addx,addy+1:m)[seq(along=x),] 
}
males<- sapply(1:6,function(i){
  tot=admissions[i,2]*SCALE
  p=admissions[i,3]/100
  x=rep(c(0,1),round(tot*c(1-p,p)))
})
allmales<-Reduce(c,males)
females<- sapply(7:12,function(i){
  tot=admissions[i,2]*SCALE
  p=admissions[i,3]/100
  rep(c(0,1),round(tot*c(1-p,p)))
})
allfemales<-Reduce(c,females)
mypar(1,1)
malepoints <- makematrix(allmales,NC)
femalepoints <- makematrix(allfemales,FNC,NC+NC/10)
NR <- max(c(malepoints[,2],femalepoints[,2]))
plot(0,type="n",xlim=c(min(malepoints[,1]),max(femalepoints[,1])),ylim=c(0,NR),xaxt="n",yaxt="n",xlab="",ylab="")
PCH=LETTERS[rep(1:6,sapply(males,length))]
o<-order(-allmales)
points(malepoints,col=2-allmales[o],pch=PCH[o],cex=CEX)
PCH=LETTERS[rep(1:6,sapply(females,length))]
o<-order(-allfemales)
points(femalepoints,col=2-allfemales[o],pch=PCH[o],cex=CEX)
abline(v=NC+NC/20)
axis(side=3,c(NC/2,NC+NC/2),c("Male","Female"),tick=FALSE,line=-1)
```

Now we stratify the data by major. The key point here is that most of the men denoted with green com from majors E and F which are the ones with the highest acceptance rate. 


```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width=14,fig.height=7}
##statify
mypar(1,1)
malepoints <- vector("list",length(males))
femalepoints <- vector("list",length(males))
N<- length(males)
 
ADDY <- vector("numeric",N+1)
for(i in 1:N){
  malepoints[[i]] <- makematrix(males[[i]],NC,0,ADDY[i])
  femalepoints[[i]] <- makematrix(females[[i]],FNC,NC+NC/10,ADDY[i])
   ADDY[i+1] <- max(malepoints[[i]][,2],femalepoints[[i]][,2])+1
}

plot(0,type="n",
     xlim=c( min(sapply(malepoints,function(x)min(x[,1]))),max(sapply(femalepoints,function(x)max(x[,1])))),
  ylim=c(0,max(sapply(femalepoints,function(x)max(x[,2])))),xaxt="n",yaxt="n",xlab="",ylab="")
          
for(i in 1:N){
  points(malepoints[[i]],col=2+sort(-males[[i]]),pch=LETTERS[i],cex=CEX)
  points(femalepoints[[i]],col=2+sort(-females[[i]]),pch=LETTERS[i],cex=CEX)
  if(i>1) abline(h=ADDY[i])
  }
abline(v=NC+NC/20)
axis(side=3,c(NC/2,NC+FNC/2),c("Male","Female"),tick=FALSE,line=-1)
axis(side=2,ADDY[-1]/2+ADDY[-length(ADDY)]/2,LETTERS[1:N],tick=FALSE,las=1)
```











## Average after stratifying

So if we condition or stratify by major this goes away. 
```{r}
y=cbind(admissions[1:6,3],admissions[7:12,3])
matplot(1:6,y,xaxt="n",xlab="major",ylab="percent",col=c("blue","red"),cex=1.5)
legend("topright",c("Male","Female"),col=c("blue","red"),pch=c("1","2"),box.lty=0,cex=0.75)
```

The average difference by Major is 3.5% higher for women.

```{r}
mean(y[,1]-y[,2])
```

## Simpson's paradox in baseball

We see this in Baseball often:

|               | 1995           | 1996           | Combined        |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Derek Jeter   | 12/48 (.250)   | 183/582 (.314) | 195/630 (.310)  |
| David Justice | 104/411 (.253) | 45/140 (.321)  | 149/551 (.270)  |

# Confounding in genomics

Here are the p-values from comparing CEU to ASN
```{r,message=FALSE}
library(Biobase)
library(genefilter)
library(GSE5859)
data(GSE5859)
```

Note that this is the original dataset from which we selected the subset used in `GSE5859Subset`. We can extract the gene expression data and sample information table using the Bio conductor functions `exprs` and `pData` like this:

```{r}
geneExpression = exprs(e)
sampleInfo = pData(e)
```

Note that some samples were processed at different times.

```{r}
head(sampleInfo$date)
```

This is an extraneous variable and should not affect the values in `geneExpression`. However, as we have seen in previous analyses it does appear to have an effect so we will explore this here.

We can immediately see that year and ethnicity are almost completely confounded:

```{r}
year = factor( format(sampleInfo$date,"%y") )
tab = table(year,sampleInfo$ethnicity)
print(tab)
```

By running a t-test and creating a volcano plot we note that thousands of genes appear to be differentially expressed. But when we perform a similar comparison between 2002 and 2003 only on the CEU population we again obtain thousands of diferentially expressed genes:


```{r}
library(genefilter)

##remove control genes
out <- grep("AFFX",rownames(geneExpression))

eth <- sampleInfo$ethnicity
ind<- which(eth%in%c("CEU","ASN"))
res1 <- rowttests(geneExpression[-out,ind],droplevels(eth[ind]))
ind <- which(year%in%c("02","03") & eth=="CEU")
res2 <- rowttests(geneExpression[-out,ind],droplevels(year[ind]))

XLIM <- max(abs(c(res1$dm,res2$dm)))*c(-1,1)
YLIM <- range(-log10(c(res1$p,res2$p)))
mypar(1,2)
plot(res1$dm,-log10(res1$p),xlim=XLIM,ylim=YLIM,xlab="Effect size",ylab="-log10(p-value)",main="Populations")
plot(res2$dm,-log10(res2$p),xlim=XLIM,ylim=YLIM,xlab="Effect size",ylab="-log10(p-value)",main="2003 v 2002")
```
