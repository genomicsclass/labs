# SNP and SNV

We start by loading all the libraries we will need for calling and annotating single nucleotide variants (SNVs).

```{r}
# biocLite("VariantAnnotation")
# biocLite("VariantTools")
# biocLite("TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene")
# biocLite("org.Hs.eg.db")
# biocLite("LungCancerLines")
# this package is 900 Mb
# biocLite("BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19")
library(VariantTools)
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
library(LungCancerLines)
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
```

## Calling variants

The `VariantTools` can be used to find variants using a reference genome and a file with aligned reads (BAM file). The reference genome needs to be a `GmapGenome`, but the `GmapGenome` function is available to convert any FASTA file to a genome for use with `VariantTools`.

Here we will examine RNA-Seq reads mapped to the TP53 gene plus 1 Mb flanking sequence.

```{r}
p53 <- gmapR:::exonsOnTP53Genome("TP53")
genome <- gmapR::TP53Genome()
?LungCancerBamFiles
bams <- LungCancerLines::LungCancerBamFiles()
path(bams)
bam <- bams$H1993
```

Again, note that the genome is not hg19.

```{r}
p53
# Bioc 2.13
library(GenomicRanges)
# Bioc 2.14
library(GenomicAlignments)
readGAlignments(bam)
```

We can write out a FASTA file for use in IGV.

```{r}
x <- as(genome, "DNAStringSet")
library(rtracklayer)
export(x, "genome.fasta")
path(bam)
```

The following call will use a binomial likelihood ratio test to call variants. From the help file:

> The test amounts to excluding putative variants with less than ~4% alt frequency. 
> A variant is also required to be represented by at least 2 alt reads. 

Regarding base quality, the help says 

> we typically use 56 for old Illumina, 23 for Sanger/Illumina1.8.

The `TallyVariantsParam` step takes some time the first time it is run (15 minutes or so).

```{r}
tally.param <- TallyVariantsParam(genome, 
                                  high_base_quality = 23L,
                                  which = range(p53) + 5e4)                             
called.variants <- callVariants(bam, tally.param)
called.variants
```

Now we will call variants for the whole region:

```{r}
tally.param <- TallyVariantsParam(genome, 
                                  high_base_quality = 23L)                                
called.variants <- callVariants(bam, tally.param)
called.variants
```

How many non-reference alleles do we see:

```{r}
hist(mcols(called.variants)$raw.count)
with(mcols(called.variants), plot(raw.count.total, raw.count, log="xy"))
(i <- which.max(mcols(called.variants)$raw.count))
called.variants[i,]
```

## Writing out VCF files

```{r}
sampleNames(called.variants) <- "H1993"
mcols(called.variants) <- NULL
vcf <- asVCF(called.variants)
writeVcf(vcf, "H1993.vcf", index = TRUE)
```

A few more details:

```{r}
?postFilterVariants
?callSampleSpecificVariants
somatic <- callSampleSpecificVariants(bams$H1993, bams$H2073, tally.param)
```


## Reading in VCF and annotating

To annotate the VCF, we start by loading a UCSC transcript database:

```{r}
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene
```

Now we read in a small subset of a VCF file, over chr22, which is stored in the VariantAnnotation package. Note that the `readVcf` function can be slow if the file is many Mb. This one is less than 1 Mb.

```{r}
library(VariantAnnotation)
fl <- system.file("extdata", "chr22.vcf.gz", package="VariantAnnotation")
vcf <- readVcf(fl, genome="hg19")
rowData(vcf)
```

Note that we can also restrict the amount we read in, either by specifying a range, or using yieldSize

```{r}
param <- ScanVcfParam(which=GRanges("22", IRanges(50.5e6, 50.6e6)))
vcf <- readVcf(fl, genome="hg19", param=param)
rowData(vcf)
?readVcf
```

We can find which variants overlap coding regions with the `locateVariants` function:

```{r}
# here we hack the chromosome from "22" to "chr22"
seqlevels(vcf) <- paste0("chr", seqlevels(vcf))
loc <- locateVariants(vcf, txdb, CodingVariants())
loc
```

We can double check that it did what we expected:

```{r}
loc[1]
g <- genes(txdb)
fo <- findOverlaps(loc[1], g)
fo
g[subjectHits(fo)]
loc[1]
```
