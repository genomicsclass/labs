# Translating addresses between genome builds: liftOver

The rtracklayer package includes an interface to the
liftOver utilities developed for the UCSC genome browser.
The idea is that a collection of local alignments
can be defined and used to remap coordinates from
one reference build to another.

We can illustrate this with gene addresses created for hg38,
the current reference build.  We want to translate them
for comparison to addresses asserted for hg19.

## Acquiring a chain file

Address translation between reference builds can be specified
using a [chain format file](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/chain.html).  Two ways of getting the chain file are:

### Direct manual acquisition

You can
get it from the following URL, and use gunzip on your
system to uncompress in your home dir, if you would
like to emulate the commands below.

"ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/liftOver/hg38ToHg19.over.chain.gz"

### Acquisition through AnnotationHub

This is fully programmatic but may involve acquiring and caching
a metadata database with the AnnotationHub package.

```{r doviaah}
library(AnnotationHub)
ah = AnnotationHub()
q1 = query(ah, c("chain")) # list all resources with 'chain' in metadata
q1
q2 = query(ah, c("chain", "hg38ToHg19")) # the one we want
ch = ah[[names(q2)[1]]]
```

```{r domyimport}
library(rtracklayer)
# following only if you do not use AnnotationHub
# ch = import.chain("~/hg38ToHg19.over.chain")
ch
str(ch[[1]])
```

Let's get the addresses for genes on chromosome 1
in hg38.

```{r get38}
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene)
tx38 = TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene
seqlevels(tx38) = "chr1"
g1_38 = genes(tx38)
```

Now execute the liftOver:

```{r doli}
g1_19L = liftOver(g1_38, ch)
```

The result is a list of GRanges, one for
each translation event.

```{r lktx}
g1_19L
```

Verification of accuracy of translation is covered in exercises.
