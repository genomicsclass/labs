# Visualizing NGS data

We will use the following libraries to demonstrate visualization of NGS data.

```{r}
#biocLite("pasillaBamSubset")
#biocLite("TxDb.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3.ensGene")
library(pasillaBamSubset)
library(TxDb.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3.ensGene)
fl1 <- untreated1_chr4()
fl2 <- untreated3_chr4()
```

We will try four ways to look at NGS coverage: using the standalone Java program IGV, using simple `plot` commands, and using the `Gviz` and `ggbio` packages in Bioconductor.

## IGV

Copy these files from the R library directory to the current working directory. First set the working directory to the source file location. We need to use the `Rsamtools` library to index the BAM files for using IGV.

```{r}
system(paste("cp",fl1,basename(fl1)))
system(paste("cp",fl2,basename(fl2)))
library(Rsamtools)
indexBam(basename(fl1))
indexBam(basename(fl2))
```

IGV is freely available for download here: https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/home

You will need to provide an email, and then you will get a download link.

Using IGV, look for gene *lgs*.

Note that if you have trouble downloading IGV, another option for visualization is the UCSC Genome Browser: http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks 

The UCSC Genome Browser is a great resource, having many tracks involving gene annotations, conservation over multiple species, and the ENCODE epigentic tracks already available. However, the UCSC Genome Browser requires that you upload your genomic files to their server, or put your data on a publicly available server. This is not always possible if you are working with confidential data.

## Simple plot

Next we will look at the same gene using the simple `plot` function in R.

```{r}
library(GenomicRanges)
```

Note: if you are using Bioconductor version 14, paired with R 3.1, you should also load this library. You do not need to load this library, and it will not be available to you, if you are using Bioconductor version 13, paired with R 3.0.x.

```{r}
library(GenomicAlignments)
```

We read in the alignments from the file `fl1`. Then we use the `coverage` function to tally up the basepair coverage. We then extract the subset of coverage which overlaps our gene of interest, and convert this coverage from an `RleList` into a `numeric` vector. Remember from Week 2, that `Rle` objects are compressed, such that repeating numbers are stored as a number and a length.

```{r}
x <- readGAlignments(fl1)
xcov <- coverage(x)
z <- GRanges("chr4",IRanges(456500,466000))
# Bioconductor 2.14
xcov[z]
# Bioconductor 2.13
xcov$chr4[ranges(z)]
xnum <- as.numeric(xcov$chr4[ranges(z)])
xnum
plot(xnum)
```

We can do the same for another file:

```{r}
y <- readGAlignmentPairs(fl2)
ycov <- coverage(y)
ynum <- as.numeric(ycov$chr4[ranges(z)])
plot(xnum, type="l", col="blue", lwd=2)
lines(ynum, col="red", lwd=2)
```

We can zoom in on a single exon:

```{r}
plot(xnum, type="l", col="blue", lwd=2, xlim=c(6200,6600))
lines(ynum, col="red", lwd=2)
```

## Extracting the gene of interest using the transcript database

Suppose we are interested in visualizing the gene *lgs*. We can extract it from the transcript database `TxDb.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3.ensGene` on Bioconductor, but first we need to look up the Ensembl gene name. We will use the functions that we learned in Week 7 to find the name.

```{r}
# biocLite("biomaRt")
library(biomaRt)
m <- useMart("ensembl", dataset = "dmelanogaster_gene_ensembl")
lf <- listFilters(m)
lf[grep("name", lf$description, ignore.case=TRUE),]
map <- getBM(mart = m,
  attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "flybasename_gene"),
  filters = "flybasename_gene", 
  values = "lgs")
map
```

Now we extract the exons for each gene, and then the exons for the gene *lgs*.

```{r}
grl <- exonsBy(TxDb.Dmelanogaster.UCSC.dm3.ensGene, by="gene")
gene <- grl[[map$ensembl_gene_id[1]]]
gene
```

Finally we can plot these ranges to see what it looks like:

```{r}
rg <- range(gene)
plot(c(start(rg), end(rg)), c(0,0), type="n", xlab=seqnames(gene)[1], ylab="")
arrows(start(gene),rep(0,length(gene)),
       end(gene),rep(0,length(gene)),
       lwd=3, length=.1)
```

But actually, the gene is on the minus strand. We should add a line which corrects for minus strand genes:

```{r}
plot(c(start(rg), end(rg)), c(0,0), type="n", xlab=seqnames(gene)[1], ylab="")
arrows(start(gene),rep(0,length(gene)),
       end(gene),rep(0,length(gene)),
       lwd=3, length=.1, 
       code=ifelse(as.character(strand(gene)[1]) == "+", 2, 1))
```

## Gviz

We will briefly show two packages for visualizing genomic data in Bioconductor. Note that each of these have extensive vignettes for plotting many kinds of data. We will show here how to make the coverage plots as before:

```{r}
#biocLite("Gviz")
library(Gviz)
gtrack <- GenomeAxisTrack()
atrack <- AnnotationTrack(gene, name = "Gene Model")
plotTracks(list(gtrack, atrack))
```

Extract the coverage. `Gviz` expects that data will be provided as `GRanges` objects, so we convert the `RleList` coverage to a `GRanges` object:

```{r}
xgr <- as(xcov, "GRanges")
ygr <- as(ycov, "GRanges")
dtrack1 <- DataTrack(xgr[xgr %over% z], name = "sample 1")
dtrack2 <- DataTrack(ygr[ygr %over% z], name = "sample 2")
plotTracks(list(gtrack, atrack, dtrack1, dtrack2))
plotTracks(list(gtrack, atrack, dtrack1, dtrack2), type="polygon")
```

## ggbio

```{r}
#biocLite("ggbio")
library(ggbio)
autoplot(gene)
autoplot(fl1, which=z)
autoplot(fl2, which=z)
```
